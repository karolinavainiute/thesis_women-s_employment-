**Title:** *The Role of Gender Norms and Parental Leave Entitlements in Shaping Women’s Employment: Evidence from OECD Countries*

This project explores the relationship between gender role attitudes, parental leave policies, and female labour force participation across OECD countries. It was completed as part of my Bachelor's in Economics and Business Economics at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in June 2025.

##  Research Objectives  
My thesis aimed to:
- **Quantify Gender Attitudes:** Construct a robust index of gender role attitudes using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to capture underlying societal norms across countries and over time.  
- **Analyse Policy Impact:** Examine how variations in parental leave entitlements relate to women's employment outcomes.  
- **Explore Interactions:** Investigate how gender norms and leave policies interact to shape labour force participation, at both the individual and country level.

##  Tools & Methods
- **Language:** R  
- **Techniques:** PCA, multivariate regression, interaction models, and visualisations
- **Workflow:** Data cleaning, dimensionality reduction, modelling, diagnostics

##  Data Sources
- **World Values Survey (WVS):** Waves 6 (2010–2014) and 7 (2017–2022). Includes global data on human values and attitudes toward gender roles.  
   Source: [www.worldvaluessurvey.org](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org)  
- **OECD Family Database – Paid Parental Leave Indicators:** Comprehensive data on national paid maternity, paternity, and parental leave policies.  
   Source: OECD Family Database (specific tables on paid leave entitlements)
- Other complementary data.

##  Code Structure
The code is divided into logical sections:

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**  
2. **Descriptive Analysis and Visualisation**  
3. **Micro-Level Models** (Individual-level regressions using WVS data)  
4. **Macro-Level Model** (Country-level model using aggregate indicators)  
5. **Models with All Principal Components** (Robustness checks and extensions)

##  Notes
